## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Supabase database with required tables
- Environment variables for identity verification providers
- Proper permissions for API access

### Setup

1. Configure provider API keys in environment variables:

```
# Onfido Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONFIDO_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
ONFIDO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=your_webhook_token

# Idenfy Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_IDENFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_IDENFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

2. Import the compliance module into your application:

```tsx
import { ComplianceDashboard } from '@/components/compliance/pages/Dashboard';

// Use in your app routes
const App = () => (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/compliance/dashboard" element={<ComplianceDashboard />} />
    {/* Add other routes as needed */}
  </Routes>
);
```

## Integration Points
