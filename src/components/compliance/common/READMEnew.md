# /src/components/compliance/common â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains shared UI components, utilities, and helpers used across multiple compliance-related modules (investor, issuer, operations, etc.). It is intended to centralize reusable compliance logic and UI for consistency and maintainability.

## Typical Contents
- Shared forms, dialogs, or widgets for compliance workflows
- Utility functions, constants, and hooks used by multiple compliance domains
- Common validation logic or error handling for compliance modules

## Usage
- Import components/utilities from this folder into any compliance submodule (investor, issuer, operations, etc.) to avoid duplication.
- Extend this folder with new shared compliance logic as needed.

## Developer Notes
- Keep logic generic and decoupled from specific compliance domains.
- Document any new shared components/utilities added here.
