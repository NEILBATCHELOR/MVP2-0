# /src/components/compliance/operations/kyc â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains components and services for KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance workflows in operational compliance. It is intended for developers building or maintaining KYC onboarding, verification, AML checks, risk assessment, and integration with third-party providers (e.g., Onfido, Idenfy).

## Structure & Contents
- **KYCAMLChecks.tsx**: UI for combined KYC/AML checks.
- **KYCComplianceDashboard.tsx**, **KYCDashboard.tsx**: Dashboards for monitoring KYC status and compliance.
- **components/**: KYC/AML widgets (verification, batch checks, risk assessment, provider integrations).
- **services/**: Business logic for AML, identity, verification, risk assessment, and provider adapters (`amlService.ts`, `onfidoService.ts`, `idenfyService.ts`, etc.).
- **operationsExtensions.ts**: Extensions for KYC/AML operational flows.
- **index.ts**: Barrel file for exports.
- (Expand as new KYC/AML workflows or integrations are required.)

## Usage
- Import these modules for KYC onboarding, verification, AML checks, or risk assessment features.
- Extend with new providers, workflows, or integrations as compliance requirements evolve.

## Developer Notes

- Document any new components, services, or integrations added here.
