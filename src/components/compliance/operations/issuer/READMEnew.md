# /src/components/compliance/operations/issuer â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains components and logic for issuer-side operational compliance, including bulk uploads, compliance dashboards, onboarding, approval workflows, asset management, document handling, and KYB (Know Your Business) verification. It is intended for developers building or maintaining issuer compliance workflows within operational compliance.

## Structure & Contents
- **IssuerBulkUpload.tsx**: UI for bulk uploading issuer data.
- **IssuerComplianceDashboard.tsx**: Main dashboard for issuer compliance operations.
- **IssuerOnboarding.tsx**: Issuer onboarding flow and logic.
- **approval/**: Approval workflows for issuer compliance actions.
- **assets/**: Asset management and compliance logic for issuers.
- **documents/**: Document management and verification for issuers.
- **kyb/**: KYB onboarding and verification for issuers.
- (Expand as new issuer compliance workflows are added.)

## Usage
- Import these modules for issuer compliance, onboarding, or asset/document management features.
- Extend with new workflows, document types, or integrations as requirements evolve.

## Developer Notes
