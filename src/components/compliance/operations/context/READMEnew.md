# /src/components/compliance/operations/context â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains context providers and state management logic for operational compliance modules. It is intended for developers building or maintaining shared context/state for compliance workflows and dashboards.

## Structure & Contents
- **ComplianceContext.tsx**: Provides React context for operational compliance state, enabling shared state across dashboards, workflows, and components.
- (Expand as new context providers or state logic are needed.)

## Usage
- Import the context provider to wrap operational compliance components, enabling shared state and logic.
- Extend with new context/state modules as operational requirements grow.

## Developer Notes
- Ensure context logic is modular, well-documented, and avoids tight coupling with specific workflows.
- Document any new context/state providers added here.
