# /src/components/compliance/operations/approvals â€” READMEnew.md

This folder contains components and services for approvals workflows within operational compliance. It is intended for developers building or maintaining approval dashboards, batch approval processors, and workflow automation for compliance actions.

## Structure & Contents
- **components/**: UI for approval workflows (`ApprovalWorkflow.tsx`), batch approval processing (`BatchApprovalProcessor.tsx`).
- **services/**: Business logic for approval workflow automation (`approvalWorkflowService.ts`).
- **ComplianceApprovalDashboard.tsx**: Main dashboard for managing and reviewing approval requests.
- (Additional files/folders may be added as approval workflows expand.)

## Usage
- Import these modules into compliance dashboards or automation flows requiring approval steps or batch processing.
- Extend with new approval types, processors, or workflow logic as compliance requirements evolve.

## Developer Notes
- Keep approval logic modular and reusable for different compliance scenarios.
- Document any new approval workflows, processors, or services added here.
