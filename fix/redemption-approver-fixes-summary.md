# Redemption Approver Selection Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Approval Requirements Should Not Feature on Every Request (Global Setting)
**Problem:** The approval threshold settings (all approvers, majority, any approver) were appearing on every redemption request form as a per-request setting.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the approval threshold dropdown from `RedemptionApproverSelection` component
- Updated the UI to indicate that approval requirements are configured globally by administrators
- Removed threshold-related state and effects from the component

### 2. Current User Can Select Themselves as an Approver
**Problem:** The current user could potentially select themselves as an approver for their own redemption request.

**Solution:**
- Added `useAuth` hook to get current user information
- Enhanced the approver filtering logic to exclude the current user from available approvers
- Added explicit check in `handleAddApprover` to prevent self-selection with user-friendly error message
- Updated the `useApprovers` hook usage to ensure current user exclusion

### 2. `/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestForm.tsx`
**Changes:**

### 3. `/src/components/redemption/types/redemption.ts`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `RedemptionApprover` interface to include `email` field for UI consistency
- ✅ Made database-specific fields optional for component usage
- ✅ Removed threshold-related properties

## Technical Implementation

### Current User Exclusion
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering to exclude current user
const availableApprovers: RedemptionApprover[] = eligibleApprovers 
  ? eligibleApprovers.reduce<RedemptionApprover[]>((unique, userObj) => {
      // Exclude current user from approver selection to prevent self-approval
      if (user && userObj.id === user.id) {
        return unique;
      }
      
      if (!unique.some(item => item.id === userObj.id)) {
        unique.push({
          id: userObj.id,
          name: userObj.name || 'Unknown',
          email: userObj.email || '',
          role: userObj.role || 'Unknown',
          avatarUrl: `https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=${(userObj.name || 'XX').substring(0, 2)}&backgroundColor=4F46E5`
        });
      }
      return unique;
    }, [])
  : [];
```

### Self-Selection Prevention
```typescript
// Prevent user from selecting themselves as an approver
if (user && approver.id === user.id) {
  setApproverError('You cannot select yourself as an approver for your own redemption request');
  return;
}
```

### Global Settings UI Update
```typescript
<div className="text-xs text-gray-400">
  Approval requirements are configured globally by administrators
</div>
```

## Benefits

1. **Security Enhancement:** Prevents users from approving their own redemption requests
2. **Simplified UI:** Removes per-request approval threshold configuration that should be system-wide
3. **Better UX:** Clear messaging about global vs. per-request settings
4. **Consistency:** Aligns with best practices where approval workflows are configured at the system level
5. **Error Prevention:** User-friendly error messages prevent confused user interactions

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation of global approval settings, consider:

1. **Global Configuration Interface:** Create an admin interface for configuring approval thresholds system-wide
2. **Database Schema:** Add global settings table for approval requirements
3. **Service Layer:** Update redemption services to read global approval configuration
4. **Role-Based Approvers:** Implement role-based approver selection (e.g., only compliance officers for high-value redemptions)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test that current user cannot see themselves in approver list
2. Test that attempting to select current user shows appropriate error
3. Test that approval threshold UI is no longer visible on redemption forms
4. Verify that existing approver selection functionality still works correctly
5. Test with different user roles to ensure proper approver filtering

## Compliance Notes

This change enhances the separation of duties principle by preventing self-approval scenarios and moving approval configuration to a centralized administrative function.
