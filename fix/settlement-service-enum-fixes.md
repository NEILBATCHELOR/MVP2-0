# Settlement Service TypeScript Enum Fixes

## Issue Summary
Fixed TypeScript type errors in `settlementService.ts` where enum objects were being assigned to database fields that expected string literal types.

## Specific Errors Fixed
- **Line 149**: `SettlementStatus.PENDING` → `'pending'`
- **Line 231**: `BurnStatus.COMPLETED` → `'completed'`
- **Line 238**: `TransferStatus.COMPLETED` → `'completed'`

## Root Cause
The enum objects defined in `types/index.ts` are const objects that return string literals, but when used as `EnumName.VALUE`, they create type mismatches with the database field types that expect direct string literals.

## Solution Applied
1. **Replaced all enum object usage with string literals** throughout the service
2. **Removed enum object imports** from the service file
3. **Maintained type imports** for type checking purposes
4. **Updated all status comparisons and assignments** to use string values

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/redemption/services/settlementService.ts`

## Changes Made
- Changed `SettlementStatus.PENDING` to `'pending'`
- Changed `SettlementStatus.COMPLETED` to `'completed'`
- Changed `SettlementStatus.CANCELLED` to `'cancelled'`
- Changed `BurnStatus.PENDING` to `'pending'`
- Changed `BurnStatus.COMPLETED` to `'completed'`
- Changed `BurnStatus.FAILED` to `'failed'`
- Changed `TransferStatus.PENDING` to `'pending'`
- Changed `TransferStatus.COMPLETED` to `'completed'`
- Changed `TransferStatus.FAILED` to `'failed'`

## Type Safety Maintained
- All type definitions remain intact
- Database schema compatibility preserved
- Runtime behavior unchanged
- Only enum object references converted to string literals

## Testing Required
- Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Test settlement initiation flow
- Test token burn and fund transfer operations
- Confirm status updates work correctly

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - All TypeScript errors resolved while maintaining type safety and functionality.
