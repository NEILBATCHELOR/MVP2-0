# Redemption Component Import Fix Summary

## Issue
**Date:** June 10, 2025  
**Error:** `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/redemption/components/RedemptionApproverSelection.tsx' does not provide an export named 'RedemptionApproverSelection'`

## Root Cause
- `RedemptionApprovalConfigModal.tsx` was importing `RedemptionApproverSelection` as a named export
- But `RedemptionApproverSelection.tsx` exports the component as a default export
- This caused a module import mismatch

## Fix Applied
**File:** `/src/components/redemption/components/RedemptionApprovalConfigModal.tsx`  
**Line:** 34

**Before:**
```typescript
import { RedemptionApprover, RedemptionApproverSelection } from "./RedemptionApproverSelection";
```

**After:**
```typescript
import RedemptionApproverSelection, { RedemptionApprover } from "./RedemptionApproverSelection";
```

## Explanation
- Changed from named import `{ RedemptionApproverSelection }` to default import `RedemptionApproverSelection`
- Kept the named import for the `RedemptionApprover` interface which is correctly exported as a named export
- This aligns with the actual export structure in the source file

## Verification
- Only one file was importing `RedemptionApproverSelection`
- No other import errors of this type exist in the redemption module
- Component should now compile and load successfully

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Import error fixed, component ready for testing
