# SwapService TypeScript Errors Fix

## Problem Summary
The SwapService.ts file had three critical TypeScript errors:

1. **Missing Module**: `Cannot find module '../MoonpayService'` - Import path referenced non-existent MoonpayService file
2. **Property Access Errors**: `Property 'from_address' does not exist` and `Property 'to_address' does not exist` - Type mismatch between database query result and expected properties

## Root Cause Analysis
- The MoonPay service architecture evolved to use specialized services (EnhancedSwapService, etc.) but SwapService still referenced the old basic MoonpayService
- Database query was only selecting specific fields but code attempted to access address fields not included in the select statement
- Missing type definitions for basic MoonPay swap interfaces

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created MoonpayService.ts
**File**: `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/MoonpayService.ts`
- Implemented basic MoonpayService class with required interface
- Added type definitions:
  - `MoonpaySwapPair` - Trading pair configuration
  - `MoonpaySwapQuote` - Quote request/response structure  
  - `MoonpaySwapTransaction` - Transaction data structure
- Provided mock implementations for development compatibility

### 2. Fixed Database Query Type Issue
**File**: `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/core/SwapService.ts`
- Updated Supabase query to include `from_address` and `to_address` in select statement
- Changed from: `select('base_currency, quote_currency, base_amount, quote_amount, status')`
- Changed to: `select('base_currency, quote_currency, base_amount, quote_amount, status, from_address, to_address')`

### 3. Updated Export Structure
**File**: `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/index.ts`
- Added SwapService and swapService exports
- Added type exports for new SwapService interfaces
- Added re-export for MoonpayService module

## Files Modified
1. `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/MoonpayService.ts` (NEW)
2. `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/core/SwapService.ts` (MODIFIED)
3. `/src/services/wallet/moonpay/index.ts` (MODIFIED)

## Verification
- All TypeScript errors in SwapService.ts resolved
- Database query now properly typed with address fields
- Module imports working correctly
- Export structure maintains backwards compatibility

## Next Steps
- Consider migrating SwapService to use EnhancedSwapService for advanced features
- Replace mock implementations in MoonpayService with actual API calls
- Add comprehensive tests for swap functionality

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED
All build-blocking TypeScript errors have been resolved.
