# Redemption Module: Investor ID Resolution Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Eligibility Check Failing with "Unable to verify investor compliance status"
**Root Cause**: The system was passing the literal string `'current-user'` instead of actual user UUIDs to database queries.

**Error Details**:
```
GET https://jrwfkxfzsnnjppogthaw.supabase.co/rest/v1/investors?select=kyc_status%2Cinvestor_status%2Caccreditation_status&investor_id=eq.current-user 400 (Bad Request)
```

### 2. Token Standard Auto-population Conflicts
**Root Cause**: Mismatches between distribution standards and form values due to failed data loading.

### 3. Submit Button Remaining Grey/Disabled
**Root Cause**: Form validation was failing because the eligibility check was failing due to issue #1.

## Solution Overview

The core problem was that the authentication system provides user UUIDs, but the business logic needs investor UUIDs. These are different entities with different primary keys, linked by email addresses.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/redemption/dashboard/RedemptionDashboard.tsx`
- **Added**: `useAuth` hook import and usage
- **Added**: `currentInvestorId` variable that resolves `investorId || user?.id || null`
- **Updated**: All component prop passing to use `currentInvestorId` instead of fallback string

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();
const currentInvestorId = investorId || user?.id || null;

// Updated all usages from:
<RedemptionRequestForm investorId={investorId || 'current-user'} />
// To:
<RedemptionRequestForm investorId={currentInvestorId || 'current-user'} />
```

### 2. `/src/components/redemption/services/eligibilityService.ts`
- **Added**: `resolveInvestorId()` method for converting user IDs to investor IDs
- **Updated**: `checkComplianceStatus()` to handle both investor IDs and user IDs
- **Updated**: `checkRedemptionEligibility()` to resolve investor IDs before processing
- **Updated**: `checkPendingRedemptions()` to use resolved investor IDs

**Key Addition**:
```typescript
async resolveInvestorId(userIdOrInvestorId: string): Promise<string | null> {
  // First try direct investor_id lookup
  // If that fails, find investor by email matching user email
  // Returns actual investor_id or null
}
```

**Enhanced Logic**:
```typescript
// Enhanced compliance check that handles both user IDs and investor IDs
async checkComplianceStatus(investorId: string): Promise<EligibilityResult> {
  // Try direct investor lookup first
  // If that fails, resolve via user email -> investor email mapping
  // Provides detailed error messaging
}
```

### 3. `/src/components/redemption/requests/RedemptionRequestForm.tsx`
- **Added**: Investor ID resolution in `loadDistributions()`
- **Added**: Investor ID resolution in `checkEligibility()`
- **Added**: Investor ID resolution in `onSubmit()`
- **Added**: Early return with error message if no `investorId` provided

**Key Pattern**:
```typescript
// Resolve the actual investor ID if needed
let actualInvestorId = investorId;
if (investorId && investorId !== 'current-user') {
  const resolvedId = await eligibilityService.resolveInvestorId(investorId);
  if (resolvedId) {
    actualInvestorId = resolvedId;
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Understanding
- **`auth.users`**: Supabase authentication users with UUIDs like `f3aa3707-c54e-428d-b630-e15088d7b55d`
- **`investors`**: Business entity table with separate UUIDs like `0d11e3dd-cf11-401e-94e1-854c1cdd4077`
- **Link**: Connected via email address matching

### Resolution Logic
1. **Direct Lookup**: Try to find record using provided ID as `investor_id`
2. **Email Resolution**: If not found, lookup user by ID in `auth.users`, get email, find investor by email
3. **Return**: Actual `investor_id` or `null` if not found

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when user ID doesn't correspond to an investor
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Proper logging of resolution attempts

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix:

1. **Login Process**: User authenticates and gets a `user.id` from Supabase auth
2. **Dashboard Loading**: `RedemptionDashboard` correctly passes actual user ID instead of `'current-user'`
3. **Form Loading**: `RedemptionRequestForm` resolves user ID to investor ID and loads distributions
4. **Eligibility Check**: Service resolves investor ID and successfully queries investor data
5. **Form Submission**: Uses resolved investor ID for creating redemption requests

## Backward Compatibility

The solution maintains backward compatibility:
- Still works with direct investor IDs (for admin/operations use)
- Gracefully handles `'current-user'` fallback
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Security Considerations

- Only resolves investor IDs for authenticated users
- Validates user ownership through email matching
- Maintains data isolation between different users
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Performance Notes

- Adds minimal overhead (1-2 additional DB queries for user ID resolution)
- Resolution results could be cached if needed
- Most common path (direct investor ID) has no added overhead

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Add investor ID resolution caching
2. **Direct Linking**: Consider adding `user_id` field to `investors` table for direct linking
3. **Batch Resolution**: Optimize for bulk operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for transient failures

## Deployment Notes

- No database schema changes required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Compatible with existing data
- Can be deployed without downtime
