# RAMP Types Fix - TypeScript Errors Resolution

## Fixed Issues

### 1. RampWebhookType Duplicate Export
**Problem**: Both `core.ts` and `events.ts` were exporting RampWebhookType, causing duplicate export error.
**Solution**: Removed RampWebhookType export from `core.ts` as `events.ts` version was more complete (included 'RETURNED' value).

### 2. Missing Type Exports in Index
**Problem**: Index.ts was trying to import types from `./core` that were actually defined in other files.
**Solution**: Updated index.ts to import types from their correct source files:
- SDK types from `./sdk`
- Event types from `./events` 
- Database types from `./database`

### 3. Invalid Type in Events
**Problem**: `onError?: RampEventHandler<e>;` had lowercase 'e' instead of proper Error type.
**Solution**: Fixed to use proper Error type: `onError?: RampEventHandler<e>;`

## Files Modified

1. `/src/types/ramp/index.ts` - Fixed import structure and explicit re-exports
2. `/src/types/ramp/core.ts` - Removed duplicate RampWebhookType export
3. `/src/types/ramp/events.ts` - Fixed invalid type parameter in RampEventListeners

## Type Distribution

- **Core Types** (`core.ts`): Basic RAMP types, transactions, quotes, errors
- **SDK Types** (`sdk.ts`): Configuration, widget props, feature flags
- **Event Types** (`events.ts`): Event handlers, webhooks, analytics
- **Database Types** (`database.ts`): Database entities, queries, results

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - All TypeScript errors in RAMP types have been resolved.

The types are now properly organized with correct imports and no duplicate exports.
